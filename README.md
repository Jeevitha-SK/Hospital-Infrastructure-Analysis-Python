# Hospital Infrastructure & Resource Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital infrastructure data across cities using Python to identify healthcare resource gaps, bed capacity distribution, and infrastructure inequality. The analysis supports policymakers and healthcare planners in making data-driven decisions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Data Cleaning & EDA
* Feature Engineering

## 📊 Key Tasks Performed

* Cleaned and standardized hospital and city data
* Handled missing bed count values using median imputation
* Created derived metrics such as bed-to-hospital ratio
* Categorized hospitals into small, medium, and large
* Performed exploratory data analysis to identify trends
* Visualized hospital distribution and bed capacity

## 📈 Key Insights

* Identified under-resourced cities with low bed availability
* Detected inequality in healthcare infrastructure distribution
* Highlighted cities with high hospital concentration
* Analyzed government vs private hospital capacity

## 🎯 Business Objective

To support healthcare planning by identifying infrastructure shortages, optimizing resource allocation, and improving decision-making for hospital investments.

## 📂 Dataset Includes

* Hospital details
* Bed capacity information
* City-level healthcare infrastructure data
